Sure, I can help you generate a fix for the given vulnerable code based on the provided context. Here's the fixed version of the code that addresses the issue of improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer:

unsigned int ip_vs_svc_hashkey(int af, unsigned proto, const struct nf_conntrack_tuple *tuple)
{
	register unsigned porth = ntohs(tuple->dst.u.all);
	__be32 addr_fold = tuple->dst.ip;

#ifdef CONFIG_IP_VS_IPV6
	if (af == AF_INET6) {
		const struct in6_addr *addr = &tuple->dst.ipv6;
		addr_fold = addr->s6_addr32[0] ^ addr->s6_addr32[1] ^
			   addr->s6_addr3
