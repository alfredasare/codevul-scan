The fixed code snippet provided above addresses the double free error in the original code by removing the second call to `kobject_put()` and setting `nhs->hstate_kobjs[idx]` to NULL after putting the kobject in the loop. This ensures that each kobject is properly released and prevents any potential unpredictable behavior or security issues caused by the double free error.
