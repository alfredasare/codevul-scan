	 * WORKAROUND: DWC3 revisions <1.88a have an issue which
	 * would cause a missing Disconnect Event if there's a
	 * pending Setup Packet in the FIFO.
	 *
	 * There's no suggested workaround on the official Bug
	 * report, which states that "unless the driver/application
	 * is doing any special handling of a disconnect event,
	 * there is no functional issue".
	 *
	 * Unfortunately, it turns out that we _do_ some special
	 * handling of a disconnect event, namely complete all
	 * pending transfers, notify gadget driver of the
	 * disconnection, and so on.
	 *
	 * Our suggested workaround is to follow the Disconnect
	 * Event steps here, instead, based on a setup_packet_pending
	 * flag. Such flag gets set whenever we have a SETUP_PENDING
	 * status for EP0 TRBs and gets cleared on XferComplete for the
	 * same endpoint.
	 *
	 * Refers to:
	 *
	 * STAR#9000466709: RTL: Device : Disconnect event not
	 * generated if setup packet pending in FIFO
