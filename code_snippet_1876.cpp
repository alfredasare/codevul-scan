Sure, I can help you generate a fixed version of the code based on the provided context and recommendation. Here's the updated code:

Fixed code:
------------

FreeWaitHandles(LPHANDLE h)
{
if (h != NULL) {
free(h);
h = NULL;
}
}

Explanation:
------------

The original code is vulnerable to CWE-415 (Double Free) and CVE-2018-9336 because it frees the memory pointed to by the `h` pointer without checking if it has already been freed before. This can lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the `h` pointer is not NULL before freeing the memory. Additionally, we set the `h` pointer to NULL after freeing it to prevent double-free vulnerabilities in case the same pointer is passed again to this function.

By adding these checks and updates, we can ensure that the function operates in a safe and secure manner, avoiding memory corruption and other security issues.
