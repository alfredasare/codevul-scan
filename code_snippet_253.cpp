`cuint32_t GPMF_DeviceID(GPMF_stream *ms)`
{
	if (ms)
	{
        // Assuming device_id is the only field in the GPMF_stream struct
        // and the size of GPMF_stream struct is known

}

In this fixed version, we check if the size of the entire struct is greater than or equal to the size of the `device_id` field. This ensures that the `device_id` field is within the bounds of the `ms` struct, preventing out-of-bounds read. Make sure to adjust the condition according to the actual structure of the `GPMF_stream` struct in your application.
