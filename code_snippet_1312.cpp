Please note that the correctness of this fix depends on the proper implementation of the `IceAcceptConnection` function and its potential error codes. The given fix assumes that the function returns `IceAcceptSuccess` when the connection is successfully established. Additionally, the `#define MAX_RETRY_COUNT 10` line should be placed outside the function definition to ensure its value is consistent across multiple calls to `accept_ice_connection`.
