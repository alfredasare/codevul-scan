void Instance::ConfigureNumberImageGenerator() {
std::vector<pp::ImageData> num\_images = GetThumbnailResources();
if (!num\_images.empty()) {
pp::ImageData number\_background = CreateResourceImage(
PP\_RESOURCEIMAGE\_PDF\_BUTTON\_THUMBNAIL\_NUM\_BACKGROUND);
number\_image\_generator_->Configure(number\_background,
num\_images.front(),
device\_scale\_);
}
}

In this fixed version, the `Configure` method is called only when the `num_images` vector is not empty. Additionally, instead of passing the entire vector, only the first element is used as an argument to the `Configure` method. This ensures that the method is called with a single, valid image, which prevents any potential buffer overflow caused by having more elements than expected in the vector.
