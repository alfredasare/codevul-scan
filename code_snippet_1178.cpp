In this fixed version, I initialized the `client_` member variable with a default value of `nullptr`, which indicates that it has not been set. I added a check in the `SetClient()` method to ensure that the `client_` is not already set before assigning a new value. This prevents the null pointer dereference vulnerability and ensures that the application behaves as expected.
