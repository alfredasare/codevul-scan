gfx::Size OmniboxViewViews::GetMinimumSize() const {
return gfx::Size(fixed_width, GetPreferredSize().height());
}

In this fixed version, the function returns a fixed width (fixed\_width) instead of calculating it based on a specific number of characters. The value of fixed\_width should be set appropriately for the specific use case, ensuring that it provides enough space for user input while not revealing sensitive information about the underlying system or its configuration.
