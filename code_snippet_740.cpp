Please note that the ellipsis (...) in the `aesni_lrw_init_tfm()` function represents the existing initialization code, which you should keep intact. The added code initializes a mutex named `release_mutex` in the `aesni_lrw_ctx` structure.

In the updated `lrw_aesni_exit_tfm()` function, the mutex is locked before calling `lrw_free_table()`, ensuring that no other thread can access or modify `lrw_table` during its release. After `lrw_free_table()` has been called, the mutex is unlocked, allowing other threads to safely access `lrw_table` again.
