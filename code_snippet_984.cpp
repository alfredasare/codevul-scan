`onig_region_init(OnigRegion* region) { region->num_regs = 0; region->allocated = 0; region->beg = calloc(1, sizeof(int)); region->end = calloc(1, sizeof(int)); region->history_root = NULL; }`

In the updated code, I have replaced the null pointer assignment with a call to the `calloc` function for both `region->beg` and `region->end`. This ensures that the memory is properly initialized to a known state (zero in this case), which helps avoid undefined behavior when these pointers are accessed later. Don't forget to free this memory in the `onig_region_free` function to prevent memory leaks.
