Please note that the provided `sanitize_input` function is a simple example that only keeps alphanumeric characters. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to use a more sophisticated sanitization method, such as a library specifically designed for input validation and sanitization. Always ensure that the chosen sanitization method is adequate for the context and data being processed.
