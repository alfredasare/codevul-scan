AuthenticatorClientPinEntrySheetModel::AuthenticatorClientPinEntrySheetModel(AuthenticatorRequestDialogModel* dialog_model, Mode mode) : AuthenticatorSheetModelBase(dialog_model), mode_(mode) {}

Here is the fixed version of the code. The `mode_` data member is now explicitly initialized in the constructor, which eliminates the issue of uninitialized memory being used (CWE-119) and helps prevent undefined behavior, thereby addressing the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-5200.
